# Rift v2.0.0 - Multi-Language Code Fusion and Deployment

Rift, created by Zen, fuses code from any language (Python, JavaScript, Java, PHP, Go, C++) into one program, optimizes it to your chosen language (Rust, Python, JS, Java), and deploys it anywhere—blockchains, cloud, or local. Built for Web3 and beyond, it’s a powerhouse with parallel processing, dynamic dependency handling, and unmatched scalability.
